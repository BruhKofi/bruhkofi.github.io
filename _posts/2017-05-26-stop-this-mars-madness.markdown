description: Questioning why the rich and powerful have taken up this new project of making the planet Mars a livable planet

In the past few years there has been talk of making the planet Mars inhabitable and or making it into some sort holiday destination. To that I say stop this madness. This is just a textbook case of displaced priorities. The rich and powerful are prepared to budget hefty sums of money to overhaul a planet they know next to nothing about.

Oh, Donald Trump also signed a bill for a manned mission to Mars that will cost approximately 450 billion USD; the man who believes climate change was cooked up by a diabolic bunch of nonentities. Of course cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency and lets build an glorified aircraft.

Common sense would suggest to just channel all this money towards reversing the totally reversible damage we have made to the earth(you know, the planet we currently LIVE on?)

So then if you happen to know Elon Musk, and the Amazon owner guy, tell them to invest that extra cash into something that is going to do us good as we long as we live on this planet. Let's face it, even if they made Mars as livable as they could, nobody is interested in going to live on a such a cold planet, no water = no beaches. We complain of jet lag on a 5 hour flight. What makes anyone think people would be interested in a 8 month trip in a space shuttle?

There are enough problems on earth that needs solving. We have not yet used up the land we have on this planet. If there are no problems where they live, by all means, go build some schools in Africa. Donate some of those fancy  Tesla solar panels to African villages.

Just Stop this madness, will you...
