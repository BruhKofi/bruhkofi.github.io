## Description
Write Away is a simple Ruby on Rails project I built some time ago. A user is able to create a post, edit, delete (typical scaffold). Other users can read and the suggests another post randomly on the sidebar.

I have stopped working on it for some time now but feel free to fork it. There are some minor issues here and there to be fixed
