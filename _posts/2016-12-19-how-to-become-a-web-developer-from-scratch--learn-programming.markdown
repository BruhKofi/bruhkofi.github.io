Learning to code is one of the most exciting things to decide to do if you start off on the right foot. It can be sometimes be unnerving as there are way to many suggestions out there on the internet when you google "how to become a become a developer". That was one of my dilemmas; not knowing where to start. This is how I did it. It is not the one path everyone has to follow to get become a software engineer but should have some useful pointers for the absolute beginner and get started writing code in no time.

Prior to wanting to pursue a career in software engineering and taking that step to learn programming , the closest I had come to developing a website or anything at all was a few blogs here and there on Blogspot back in the day and WordPress. I noticed after a while I especially liked simple, easy to use platforms and that arose my curiosity enough to want to pursue it. What you want to do is to learn as much as possible to get you through that first door; your first job, then you get the wealth of your experience and applicable knowledge on the job. I landed my first job in web development 5 months after I decided to become a web developer and it has been a learning process from then on. These are a few pointers:

### Show up at a Meetup
I had decided to become a software developer but didn't know where to start. I wanted to learn as much about everything, then decide which particular kind of developer I want to be after I have found my sweet spot.  If you already know whether you want to be a front end developer of a back end developer, that’s great. I went Full Stack. Living in Berlin also obviously has got it perks. The startup culture is so rich that new companies are springing up everywhere so there is almost no shortage of developers to learn from. So one of the first things I did after I got my new laptop was show up at a meetup. You can find meetups in and around your area. This website is what I used to find my first meetups. I would show up, talk to people, listen to what kind of projects they are working on, ask them how best I could get started. And needless to say you need those connections – you are going to be looking for a job pretty soon.

### Bootcamps
There are countless programs out there (paid and unpaid)  to teach you how to become a developer. Look up on the internet for good ones around your area, see what kind and quality of developers they have churned out over the last couple of years to give u a sense of what you are getting for your money. Other than that, there are also unpaid ones you can join. I joined [Refugees on Rails](http://refugeesonrails.org){:target="_blank"}, a very [innovative program launched by some enterpreneurs in Berlin and a few other cities in Germany](http://mashable.com/2015/10/14/entrepreneurs-launch-coding-school-for-refugees-in-germany/#s1rDBBgMkEqG){:target="_blank"} to help refugees get back on their feet by teaching them to code. I am not a refugee but I just asked one of the founders at a meetup if I could join and she said yes so why not. And I had the opportunity of meeting some amazing people in the process(win-win) Sometimes all you need to do is ask.

### Where To Start
I started off learning [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/){:target="_blank"}, a web application framework written in Ruby. I enjoyed learning rails because I learnt and continue to learn lots every day.I started out building one page websites(my first portfolio website). It is important to start building something you think you are actually going to be using in the long round. The first projects do not always become the million dollar ideas but the motivation doesn't hurt. With Rails ended up having to study up on both frontend and backend development. HTML and CSS(twitter bootstrap) for the front end of most projects. Later moved on to experiment with HAML. Then the understanding of basic the principles of  MVC(Model, View, Controller), having to design databases for bigger apps, and deploying a finished app yourself
Learn Programming Online
You can learn almost everything these days on the internet. We spend hours on end watching funny videos and hanging out on social media website which is all good but while we are at it, we could as well open one other tab and get the try take some online coding classes  These are a few of the sites that helped me enormously to have a more structured approach to my learning process.

### Plenty of Humility
Drop that big boy pants; you are going to run into people that know way more than you do. Key is you submit to learning as much from everyone you meet irrespective of how you feel or think of them especially in a company. Keep a warm personality and siphon as much knowledge as you can.

### Get Good Headphones
Just get good headphones, get good music, tune the noise out and start writing some code

This is not by all means the only way to start off a career. Any tips and suggestions are welcome in the comment section...always
