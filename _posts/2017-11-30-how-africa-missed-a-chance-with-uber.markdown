        <p>Uber: well they need no introduction. After successfully seeing their concept through and becoming a force in US, Europe, etc they decided to enter Africa. As usual Ghanaians jumped on the bandwagon and made Uber one of the most thriving tech companies in Ghana.</p>

Fair enough...I don't have anything against their successful launch in our market though the inability of 
the government to help local startups with similar services and products as being offered by western counterparts is appalling but that is for another day.

We can all agree that Ghana's transportation system is a mess. Taxi services while not all that bad in my opinion is not as productive as it can be. Taxi drivers have to stay parked at points and wait for passengers to come to them. OR they will drive around town hoping someone will stop them. For a country who's fuel prices is among the highest in the world, you would think we could have taken advantage of Uber.

Traffic is so congested that the time required to drive on average per kilometer is double and sometimes triple the time it should ideally take. Case and point, Uber triggered an influx of car imports because private people now needed buy cars that meet the Uber specifications to start using the platform. This doesnt only have regulatory implications but also not even good for the environment. 

Now let's use Germany as an example. Uber wasn't allowed to just allowed to make everyone start using their private cars as a convenient taxi. It would have collapsed the taxi services and knowing very well the economic implications, Uber was allowed to launch provided only taxi services could use it. This was kind of intervention that would have been needed for Ghana. Taxi drivers would have been able to maximise sales and minimise waste of time and resources.

I tend to be a believer in the fact that not every tech developed in the western world is neccesarily a perfect fit for an african market. There is the need for a few tweaks here and there because it is an admittedly different ecosystem. There are different problems that need tailor made solutions and in the absence of leaders who are innovative enough or at least willing to include the young and vibrant players in african tech, we will continue to miss these opportunities to leverage what these foreign tech companies have to offer for the good of the local industries.
