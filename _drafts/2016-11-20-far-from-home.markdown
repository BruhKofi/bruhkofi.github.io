## FLY OFF


Nobody said the way up to goals is supposed to be all easy. At the end of the day you are going to have to go with your guts and be prepared to go against the odds. There are those that watch while people do stuff and those who do stuff. From, Ghana, West Africa, I made my way miles away from home to Berlin...well to Soest in North-Rhine Westfallen, Germany. I am not going to downplay it and act like it was nothing...it was HUGE!  Visa in hand but no money left to buy a 700 euro ticket so the frenzy begins...calling everyone I knew for a loan. There was no way this was not going to happen.

Fast forward, kid brother sees me off at the airport and I am acting all like this was not a big deal...Hell it was. The ruined Helicopter in the Aburi Garden was the closest I had come to being in any flying machine but there I was playing it all cool like it was nothing....right. Then came the small talk, the overdressed man who had obviously been outside the country in a couple of times, the first timer who was trying to impress me with his A1 or A2 Deutsch like "Do you know how to say good morning in German?"

Transit in Turkey - a bigger airport, about 18 hours of waiting and I didnt have anything against that which is funny cos a 30 min flight delay makes me impatient. And there was the first racist experience where the Mama asks her kid not to sit with the black guy, and the elderly black woman who noticed it was my first time in these parts and gave me a much needed lecture about being focused and not squandering my chances.

Endlich in Berlin -  touchdown, gates open....how is so cold? Nobody tell you winter is this cold apparently. even if they did, there was no way I would have been able to have similated this in my wildest imageination. Obviously I have never needed a jacket in my life so I showed up with a long sleeve shirt. I could literally feel people where feeling sorry for my plight. As my luck will have it Fahrkarte Kontrolle caught me on the train - my first brush with the law within 40 min of getting into the country.

Fast Fast Forward Soest ended up not happening....I missed my deadline by a day. I was going to spend the next few days in a hostel with about 20 or so other guys while I tried to find make a home out of my new city....first of all, I would go to TKMAX tomorrow and get me the thickest and cheapest jacket I can get with the rest of the money I had on me. Making my parents send me money was not an option because the Euro is undoubtedly too strong of a currency and they still got the siblings to take care off....this story will continue sometime on (FAR FROM HOME, NOW WHAT? ) but for now I gotta go write about Tech
