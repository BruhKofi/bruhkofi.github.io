In the past few years there has been talk of making the planet Mars inhabitable and or making it into some sort holiday destination. To that I say stop this madness. Are priorities displaced?

The Trump also signed a bill for a manned mission to Mars that will cost approximately 450 billion USD; the man who believes climate change was cooked up by a diabolic bunch of nonentities. Of course cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency and lets build an glorified aircraft.

Common sense would suggest to just channel all this money towards reversing the damage we have made to the earth
