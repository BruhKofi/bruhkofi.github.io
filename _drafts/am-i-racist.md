body: "I know what you are thinking? Black people cannot be racist. Thats not the
  point. So we are sitting at the dinner table, a couple of Ghanaian friends and the
  german partner of the evening's host. \n\nBeing the only white person in the room
  we decided to not make it awkward for him or let him feel left out by speaking Twi
  (even though its hard not to speak your mother tongue when with your countrymen).
  Every now and then we would forget and speak twi but immediately realize it and
  translate it to english or german.\n\nSo back to when I felt like a racist. After
  eating we were talking about Ghana - what there is to be seen, what a first time
  visitor has to expect. My friend was talking about how unsafe it is to drive in
  Ghana unend and I found myself blurting out 'du bist so ne deutscher' (you are such
  a german). \n\nJust as I said that I realized I may have just messed up. Not like
  a white person and the N-word messed up but still the thought that I might have
  made this person at this material moment feel alienated through my utterance made
  me feel disgusting.\n\nSo I guess the real question is not whether I am racist.
  It is how do racists live with themselves. It should require deep seated lack of
  human emotions to declare hatred for a whole segment of the world's population and
  not feel bad about it. \n\nLet it sink in"
